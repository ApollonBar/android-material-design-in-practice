### Design reference and guidelines for TAP apps.

- This project is meant to showcase the color palette, typography and shapes with the latest material design.
- Uses appropriate theming to apply app wide as well as widget specific styles.
- Min SDK support is API 16
- The app will respond and auto switch to day/ night mode depending on the system settings.
- Use https://material.io/resources/color for preparing a color scheme for the "Base Color Scheme".
- If you wish to try different new schemes, only change the "Base Color Scheme". Leave 'Other colors' constant since they are neutral.
